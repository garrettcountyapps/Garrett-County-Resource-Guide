Ryan White HIV Garrett County Health Department,"The Ryan White Program at the Garrett County Health Department provides case management and  support to HIV positive clients. The HIV virus is an infection that is spread from person to person through blood and body fluids.  Although there is currently no cure for HIV, it can be treated with daily medications that decrease the HIV viral load in the bloodstream.  When a HIV positive person's viral load is ""undetectable"", they do not spread the virus to others. It is very important for anyone with HIV to be able to go to the doctor regularly,  get their medications, and take care of themselves on a daily basis. This will not only help the person to live a long, healthy life, it will stop the spread of the infection to others. Everyone benefits. Our case management program  assists clients with obtaining medical care, medications, housing, food, transportation, education and other support to help them obtain and stay in good health.

One of the most dangerous parts of HIV is not knowing that you have it.  The Garrett County Health Department offers free HIV testing.

For more information on the Ryan White Program or free HIV testing, please call Personal Health  301-334-7770.

Adult Evaluation and Review Services - AERS,"Adult Evaluation &amp; Review Services (AERS) offers a free evaluation to assess Garrett County residents, 18 or older, for available community resources.  The goal of the program is to link clients with resources which may enable them to stay in their home as long as possible.  AERS evaluations are conducted in the individual's home or other locations as requested.  The AERS team consists of a registered nurse and licensed social worker who will develop a plan of care involving the client and the family as appropriate.  The AERS team works with multiple community agencies to provide a comprehensive evaluation and offer referrals for assessed individuals.

A referral for an AERS evaluation can be made by the individual, family member(s), healthcare provider, or others by calling 301-334-7740 or 301-895-3111.  Basic demographic information is helpful at the time of the call (name, address, date of birth, a basic idea of income/assets, and the reason for the referral).

After the evaluation is complete, the nurse will make recommendations to available community resources.  Although the AERS evaluation is free, many of the resources are income and asset based.  Resources may include: Alzheimer's education, private duty caregiver listings, in-home services (personal care attendant and/or light household chores), medication assistance, MedBank of Garrett County, Meals on Wheels, respite funds, clinical services (vision, hearing, dental/dentures, behavioral health etc.), housing and transportation assistance.

Adventure Sports Center International,"Adventure Sports Center International is an Olympic standard white water rafting and canoe/kayak slalom center located on the mountaintop above the Wisp Ski Resort at Deep Creek Lake, McHenry, Maryland, United States. In addition to serving as a venue for slalom races and training, the center offers a range of services to the general public including guided raft trips, inflatable kayak rentals, and riverboard rentals.The center opened in May 2007, constructed at a cost of $24 million, and is the third pump-powered artificial whitewater facility built in North America. Its educational partner in water sports instruction is the Adventuresports Institute of nearby Garrett College, which offers degrees in outdoor adventure sports.HistoryThe concept of Adventure Sports Center International originated after the 1989 Whitewater Slalom World Championships on the remote Savage River in Western Maryland. Sergi Orsi, then president of the International Canoe Federation encouraged the organizers of the 1989 Savage River event to build a pump-powered artificial whitewater course in a more accessible location nearby. The Maryland state government supported the project to promote summer tourism in the region.Since the Wisp Ski Resort already had a pump-filled mountaintop reservoir to supply its snowmaking machines with water in the winter, the artificial whitewater course was sited next to this reservoir to make use of its water in the summer. The roads, motels, and restaurants which served the ski area in the winter made the location accessible to summer visitors.",wellness-programs;business,,,,(877) 300-2724,,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Adventure-Sports-Center-International/122957147762822,,3313

"Property Owners' Association of Deep Creek Lake, Inc.","The Property Owners' Association of Deep Creek Lake, Inc. was granted a corporate charter by the State of Maryland in 1949 and grew out of 'Deep Creek Lake Association', founded sometime prior to 1938. It was formed to serve as the representative organization for lake residents. time that service has taken many forms including advocating for the members with county, state and federal officials, representing members' interests on various community leadership boards, contributing to community initiatives, providing legal interventions and always maintaining communication with the membership on issues of importance for quality of life at the lake and the entire watershed.

The POA is now a not for profit corporation which is an open, democratic institution and holds membership meetings twice a year that are open to the public as well as Board meetings that are open to the POA membership. The directors volunteer their services, and 100% of the membership dues directly support the POA mission. The Board is elected by the members and over the years the leadership of the POA has forged long term and close working relationships with all of the entities having any responsibility for Deep Creek Lake.

The last decade has seen numerous changes to the lake area and the POA has played a significant role in those changes. The state agency having the largest responsibility in relation to Deep Creek Lake is the Department of Natural Resources. For many years prior to the State's acquisition of the lake, the POA had a designated member on a DNR advisory body pertaining to the governance of the lake. The role of that body, however, was changed dramatically in connection with the acquisition of Deep Creek Lake by the State of Maryland. Prior to the acquisition of the lake, the advisory committee was just that, i.e., advisory, and it had no real role other than that of an advisor. When the process began for acquiring Deep Creek Lake (a process prompted by the POA's proposal to the Maryland General Assembly that a special taxing district be created to acquire the lake), the POA worked with DNR officials and State legislators to establish a new Policy and Review Board which, by statute, includes the POA President or designee as a board member. Of greater importance, however, is the fact that the legislation adopted contemporaneously with the acquisition of Deep Creek Lake provided that no regulation affecting the lake, nor any fee, may be established without the review and approval of the Policy and Review Board.

The POA also worked closely with DNR officials in connection with the acquisition of the lake and, working with the late Eugene Lynch, Secretary of the Department of General Services, we were able to negotiate conditions under which property owners could ""buy down"" excess land between their property and the buffer strip. Also of importance is the fact that the POA was successful in convincing the State to include in the buy down process the right of a property owner, whose well or septic system later fails, to extend a septic system into the buy down parcel subject, however, to ordinary Health Department approvals.

The POA has also worked diligently to establish good working relationships with the County Commissioners. POA officers meet on a regular basis with the County Commissioners, and a number of past and present Board members have served the county government in a variety of capacities to foster a close and respectful relationship. Members of the POA board of directors serve on many other boards and organizations such as Garrett Zoning and Planning Commission, DNR's Water Quality Study Work Group, Emergency Planning Committee, Chamber of Commerce, Garrett College Foundation and many other non profit boards in the area. POA board members are involved not only as board members but also as active community volunteers.

The POA has hosted two Workshops, one in December 2010 and the other in December 2011. The purpose of these successful gatherings was to bring together representatives of those organizations who care about a healthy lake and to improve communication between and among these groups. The North American Lake Management Society, NALMS, is the leading national association addressing the issues facing all who advocate for healthy lakes. As a member, the POA has access to their years of expertise and guidance on the issues facing Deep Creek Lake. It has provided funding for the annual fireworks display, the purchase of defibrillators for all Sheriff's Department cruisers, the cell phones for use by the NRP, for the gypsy moth spraying and to the cost of Phase II of the DNR Sedimentation Study of the lake.

The POA board of directors seeks to maintain open communication and cooperation with local and state officials. In preparation for the 2010 elections, we drew up a series of questions for the candidates that covered issues of particular concern to our membership. The responses were shared with the membership to help them make informed decisions in supporting candidates. To establish our connection with the newly elected county commissioners, we held a “getting to know you” social for them during the winter holiday week.

Throughout the years, the major function of the POA continues to be keeping our membership informed on issues affecting property owners. In the past decade we have added to the traditional printed newsletter, The Deep Creek Dispatch, with the electronic eDispatch. The move into the information age technology has enabled us to provide ongoing communication beyond our quarterly newsletters. We now send eBlasts to our members for timely notices and updates. r These communications allow us to alert members on urgent matters as well as provide rumor control on others. In addition to email communications, the POA has this website. The site contains answers to FAQs about lake use, regulations, resources and specific functions of the POA.

The POA is the oldest and largest organization advocating for the interests of the stake holders of Deep Creek Lake. There are other organizations that have an interest in Deep Creek Lake, and the more organizations cooperating and advocating for the lake, the better.

Oakland B&O Museum,"The Past…

It began with a vision by primarily two men, John Work Garrett who was ultimately the President of the B&amp;O and E. Francis Baldwin who was the primary architect of the B&amp;O buildings. These men built many of the B&amp;O buildings from the Central Building and Camden Station in Baltimore, to the station in Parkersburg, WV.

Mr. Garrett became the president of the B&amp;O in 1858 after a acrimonious stockholders fight. Mr. Garrett was bound to stockholders with a promise of a good return on their investments and caught in a race to see to see which would be the major railroad line to the west, the B&amp;O or the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Railroads were trying to provide the fastest and most convenient service at the cheapest rates.

John also got caught up in the Civil War with promises to dedicate the railroad to the Union and promised President Lincoln that trains would serve the Northern cause. Mr. Garrett was powerful in Annapolis, the halls of Baltimore and very influential in the development of Western Maryland.

When the last county in Maryland was granted the right to govern itself, they decided to take his name. He rewarded it with a beautiful train station, a church and several hotels. The railroad helped vacationers to reach these southern destinations. Mr. Garrett died in September of 1884 in his cottage in Deer Park, the same year the Oakland Station was begun.

The Present…

With strong support from the community, the B&amp;O Committee and under the leadership of the Mayor and Town Council of Oakland, the 1884 B&amp;O Railroad Station has undergone a complete, historically-accurate restoration.

The exterior renovations included the repair of historic windows, roof shingles, gutters and general painting. Interior renovations included the addition of a central air system, humidity controls, ultraviolet light filters, refinished floors, painting and upgrades to the heating and security systems.

The B&amp;O Museum Committee has been busy building partnerships with a variety of organizations, local governments as well as private foundations in order to preserve the train station. Additionally, the museum received a project grant from the Maryland Heritage Area s Authority Financing Fund through the Mountain Maryland Gateway to the West Area for the upcoming exhibit space that is needed.

The Future…

It began with a vision long ago and now it is looked upon with a new vision, it includes preserving the past and educating a new generation.

The B&amp;O Train Station is going to house the B&amp;O Museum. It’s Queen Anne style architecture is the centerpiece of Oakland’s history and it is one of the most distinguished, historic depots in the country.

In 1974, the Station itself was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

The Museum will feature many local artifacts. It will also feature rotating exhibits and artifacts from the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD which is an independent nonprofit education institution and it possesses the oldest, most historic and most comprehensive American railroad collections in the world.

It is in integral part of Garrett County and in particular Oakland’s history. It will also become part of the local Main Street Community and will contribute to the educational center in downtown Oakland. A portion of the museum will contain an educational center serving school aged children, the local community and visitors.

The opening of the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Oakland will complete the third museum in downtown Oakland. The Garrett County Historical Society Museum and the newly completed Transportation Museum have been popular destinations for many visitors. This unique historic resource is a wonderful and treasured part of the county’s heritage.",business;arts,,,,(301) 334-3204,http://www.oaklandbandomuseum.org/,https://www.facebook.com/Oakland-BO-Museum-390391907750826/,,2700

Solid Waste and Recycling Home

The Garrett County Department of Solid Waste and Recycling strives to provide an integrated, cost effective, and environmentally sound solid waste disposal system to all county residents, homeowners, and commercial enterprises. We provide a service to the community and develop strong, cooperative relationships with businesses, independent haulers, municipalities, contractors, regulatory authorities, and the general public. We continually find ways to educate people of all ages about the importance of reducing the amount of waste generated in each household and reusing materials or donating them to those in need. Reducing the amount of merchandise purchased or buying in bulk and composting are also activities that help to divert materials from the Landfill. The County promotes and encourages recycling efforts and will provide as many recycling opportunities as possible where economically feasible and not in conflict with private sector initiatives.

Garrett County Solid Waste Disposal and Recycling Facility, also known as the County Landfill, is located off Oakland Sang Run Road, 3.5 miles north of Oakland and 2 miles south of Bray School Road. The facility is available for use by all county residents, businesses, municipalities, visitors and private haulers collecting waste generated within the county.

The county also maintains six refuse &amp;recycling sites conveniently located throughout the county. These sites are available for use by homeowners to dispose of household waste, certain bulk items and recyclables. These sites are NOT available for trash disposal use by businesses, municipalities, or private haulers; however, Garrett County businesses and municipalities are encouraged to use the free recycling boxes at the landfill and the six refuse &amp; recycling sites.",government,dwbaker@garrettcounty.org,,,301.387.0322,https://www.garrettcounty.org/solid-waste-recycling,,,2408

When Sam Walton opened the doors to the first Walmart in 1962, his goal was to save people money so they can live better. Sam was a firm believer in listening to what his customers had to say. That tradition continues today. But now, it doesn’t have to end when you leave the store. Through Facebook, we’re able to talk to you, find out what’s on your mind and let you know what we’re up to. It’s just another way we’re working to give the millions of families who shop at Walmart more of what they love—ways to save money and live better.",business,,,,(301) 334-8400,http://www.walmart.com,https://www.facebook.com/Walmart2894/,,4793

Maryland Medicaid Health Choice Program Administrative Care Coordination/Ombudsman Services,"What is HealthChoice?
HealthChoice is Maryland's Medicaid managed care program. Most people who qualify for Medicaid are required to enroll in a Managed Care Organization (MCO). It is best to select an MCO that your doctor participates with. If your doctor does not participate in the MCO you select or are assigned to, you will need to choose another primary care doctor (PCP) to over see your medical care.
What is a HealthChoice MCO?
An MCO is a group of doctors, clinics, and other health care providers who work together to take care of HealthChoice member health care needs.
MCOs are responsible to provide or arrange for most of your health care services including most pharmacy services. Some services such as mental health and substance use disorder services. Some services such as mental health and substance use disorder services and certain drugs are covered by the State and not your MCO. The ACC serves as a local resource for all HealthChoice memebers. The ACC can:
Help you understand your HealthChoice benefits and how to access services
Explain your MCO choices
Help you find a primary care doctor or specialist in your MCO's network (You can change PCPs at any time)
Help you find a denist for our child (MCOs are not required to cover dental services for adults)
Help link you to Medicaid transportation services (MCOs are not required to provide transportation.)
Help you get your prescriptions filled
Explain the health care services you can get out of network and without a referral, like prenatal care (if you already started prenatal care) and family planning services
Explain your annual right to change MCOs
More examples of help that is only a phone call away
Explain how to renew your Medicaid benefits through the Maryland Health Connection
Explain how to keep your information updated and how to get a new Medicaid card if your card is lost or stolen
Help you resolve a billing issue
Explain your appeal &amp; grievance rights
Target population include children, pregnant and postpartum women, individuals with disablities (physical, mental, or develpmental), and homeless individuals. The ACC can help anyone who is eligible for HealthChoice.
Ombudsman
The local Ombudsman acts as an advocate for your health care needs. An Ombudsman may contact you when there are complex medical issues involving care coordination with MCO. The HealthChoice Program may also request that an Ombudsman contact you to ensure that any complaints that you have about your health care or MCO have been resolved.",hospitals-and-health-services,,,,1.800.284.4510,,,,2289

WMHS After-Hour Emergency,"Emergency Behavioral Health Services provides a professional counselor who is available 24 hours per day, every day of the year in the Emergency Department at the Western Maryland Regional Medical Center.  These counselors are specially trained in the provision of Crisis Assessment and Intervention for patients and families who present with emotional, psychiatric or addiction related issues.

Patients and families are interviewed to determine the presenting problems, obtain a brief history of the problem and evaluate the degree of stress and decompensation.  All patients are medically examined by the Emergency Department Physician before seeing the counselor.  After the counselor completes the evaluation, a disposition is determined and the patient is referred to the least restrictive level of care.  A psychiatrist is available on call for consultation if needed.

<article id=""post-11"">Located in communities throughout Maryland, Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs Service Officers assist veterans and their eligible dependents in acquiring benefits. For assistance, contact the full time office most convenient to you. Appointments for satellite offices may be scheduled through the Program office nearest the satellite location.During your initial visit with MDVA staff, they will review military separation discharge documents, DD214’s and individual circumstances of service in order to provide the best possible assistance.  Staff will review the three elements of the VA system: the Veterans Health Administration, Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemeteries Administration.  A review of Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs programs will also be completed to include the Maryland Cemetery Program, Charlotte Hall Veterans Home, as well as other Maryland programs designed to assist veterans.  A typical visit can also generate a disability compensation/pension claim for submission to the Veterans Benefits Administration. Our Service Officers assist with developing, preparing and submitting compensation/pension claims to the Veterans Benefits Administration.  For veterans and dependents who receive our services, staff will track processing claims and assist with additional development requests made by the Veterans Benefits Administration.  Once the claims process has been completed, our staff review the Veterans Benefits Administration decision and, if successful, review all applicable ancillary benefits.  It pays to seek representation when filing claims for federal Veterans Affairs disability benefits.  The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs data shows that veterans represented by accredited organizations receive significantly greater disability benefits than their non-represented counterparts.</article>",veterans,,,,301.759.5251,http://veterans.maryland.gov/maryland-department-of-veterans-affairs-service-benefits-program/,,,4324
American Red Cross: Service to the Armed Forces,"<p align=""LEFT"">The Service to the Armed Forces (SAF) program dates back to the establishment of the American Red Cross by Clara Barton in May 1881. Not only did the “Angel of the Battlefield” risk her life tending to soldiers wounded in the Civil War, she bolstered their morale by writing letters for them to send to their families. Today’s American Red Cross workers proudly carry on this tradition through the SAF program, which serves as a critical line of communication between the U.S Armed Forces and their families.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">The SAF program in the National Capital Region supports military personnel, veterans, and families on 14 separate military installations in the Washington, DC region, at the Veteran’s Administration Hospital, and throughout the community. Key installations supported include: Quantico MCB, Walter Reed NMMC, Fort Belvoir, JB Andrews, JB Myer-Henderson Hall, JB Anacostia-Bolling, and the Pentagon. As the largest Red Cross volunteer area in the National Capital Region, there is a team of nearly1,000 active volunteers supporting the SAF mission throughout the region. Volunteers range from civilian to active duty, from administrative up to PhD and MD who practice to the full extent of their credentials and support activities across the region to include greeting every wounded, ill and injured service member who arrives via MEDEVAC. During the summer months we add a robust program of youth volunteers.</p>",veterans,,,,1.877.272.7337,http://www.redcross.org/local/washington-dc/programs-services/military-families-services,,,1380

<h1>Student Assistance Program (SAP)</h1>
</header>In Bedford and Somerset Counties, every school has a Student Assistance Program (SAP) that is designed to assist school personnel in identifying issues including alcohol, tobacco, other drugs, and mental health issues which pose a barrier to a student’s success. The primary goal of SAP is to help students overcome these barriers in order that they may achieve, remain in school, and advance.
The core of the program is a professionally trained team, including school staff and liaisons from community mental health and drug and alcohol agencies. SAP team members are trained to identify problems and to make recommendations to assist the student and the parent. The SAP team will assist the parent and student to access services within the community as needed.

The SAP team members do not diagnose, treat or refer to treatment; but they may refer for a screening or an assessment for treatment.

<h1>Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP)</h1>
</header>Children and Adolescent Services System Program (CASSP) focuses on the need for interagency collaboration and coordination across systems in delivering multiple services to seriously emotionally disturbed children /youth and their families. In Bedford and Somerset Counties, CASSP provides a coordinated, comprehensive, child-centered approach for all agencies, schools, and family members to develop, collaborate and coordinate services for children/youth. CASSP assists children/youth involved in more than one child-serving system including but not limited to Juvenile Probation, Children and Youth Services, Drug and Alcohol Services, Schools, etc., to gain access to needed services. A CASSP Coordinator facilitates interagency team meetings, as needed with all involved parties, for the purpose of developing multiagency plans of care for individual children and youth with serious emotional disturbance especially when the current system is not adequately meeting their needs. Family involvement is very important and members present are given the opportunity to discuss their concerns, needs, and expectations.

No fee is associated with CASSP. However, there may be some costs involved for services recommended by the Interagency Team.

Referral is required by agency staff, school personnel, family members, or concerned persons.
<h5>The Goals of CASSP include:</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Promoting the development of a wide array of services to meet the needs of identified children,</li>
 	<li>Integrating multiple services into a well-coordinated system of care to make sure children are receiving the most appropriate services, and</li>
 	<li>Increasing the ability of parents and professionals to work together for the benefit of the child.</li>
</ul>
<h5>CASSP Principles</h5>
<ul>
 	<li>Services are child centered</li>
 	<li>Services are family focused</li>
 	<li>Services are community based</li>
 	<li>Services are planned in collaboration with all systems involved with the child</li>
 	<li>Services are culturally competent</li>
 	<li>Services are least restrictive and least intrusive as possible</li>

Allegany Health Nursing & Rehabilitation,"Our centers offer rehabilitation services, including physical, occupational and speech therapies. Our skilled nursing services include wound care, IV care, pain management, and infectious disease care. Several offer stroke rehabilitation, on-site dialysis, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and other types of specialized care.

Many Mid-Atlantic Health Care centers are equipped with Step Up Units™ that serve patients with more complex medical needs. These units often permit earlier discharge from the hospital and minimize the need to transfer patients to the acute care hospital.

To further improve patient care and staff communication, Mid-Atlantic developed Real Time Medical Systems (RTMS), a platform that gives staff an intuitive, real-time dashboard that displays patient data. When a patient has additional needs, the system immediately informs staff of the need for a care intervention — enabling them to proactively monitor, identify and treat the patient at the facility, while preventing hospital re-admission. Since implementation of this platform, Mid-Atlantic has seen a 50% reduction in hospital readmissions.

In 2013, Mid-Atlantic became one of the first companies to go live with a CMS Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BCPI) Model 3 program. This program seeks to provide more coordinated care to patients at a lower cost to Medicare by bundling payments to post-acute providers in order to align incentives.

We are able to do this by providing in-home elderly care services like:</span>

Senior companion care, or companionship, provides emotional support, friendship, and socialization. Common home companion care activities include:
<ul>
 	<li>Conversation and mental stimulation, such as playing games or listening to music</li>
 	<li>Meal prep and time spent together over breakfast, lunch or dinner</li>
 	<li>Light activity, such as a walk or time spent outside</li>
 	<li>Laundry and light housekeeping</li>
 	<li>Grocery shopping and errands</li>
 	<li>Transportation to and from appointments and social events</li>
 	<li>Reminders for personal care and grooming</li>
 	<li>Medication reminders</li>
</ul>
Comfort Keepers’ goal is to assist our clients with their personal home care routines so they can look and feel their best. Studies show undeniable benefits for seniors’ self-esteem and emotional fitness to have regular hygiene and grooming. We are here to help clients who fear falling while bathing or have limitations that make grooming tasks difficult.
<h4>These tasks may include:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Showering and bathing</li>
 	<li>Getting dressed, including shoes and accessories (belt, watch, jewelry, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Brushing teeth or dentures</li>
 	<li>Styling and brushing hair</li>
 	<li>Makeup application</li>
 	<li>Shaving with an electric razor</li>
</ul>
Custom transportation services from a home caregiver give immobile seniors their legs back—figuratively speaking of course. It brings a return to more independent living, thus improving the client's quality of life. Third-party transportation solutions help seniors because they don't like to rely on family or friends all the time. Nor is such an arrangement convenient in a lot of situations.

Through comfort Keepers' chauffeuring services, clients get to stay socially active. They also have access to life's essentials like local services and public events, etc. Other benefits may include:
<ul>
 	<li>No more concerns about traveling alone</li>
 	<li>If feels good knowing you have a ride when you need one</li>
 	<li>You maintain a connection with the outside world—on your terms</li>

Homeowner Services,"&nbsp;

GCCAC believes that one of the best ways to become financially self-sufficient is to build assets. Assets are things you own that can increase in value over time. One type of asset is a house. Homeownership is a goal that many clients work towards, and, so far, over 300 low-income families have achieved in the last 15 years in Garrett County through the First Time Home Buyers Program, administered by GCCAC.

<img src=""https://www.garrettcac.org/images/Graphics/Deed.png"" alt=""Deed"" width=""80"" height=""91"" />Once a home is purchased, it is important to maintain it and make the necessary repairs to keep it a safe and healthy place to live. GCCAC offers Home Repair and Rehabilitation grants and loans to assist homeowners in making repairs to their homes. The agency also runs a Weatherization program so that weatherization measures can be installed in eligible low-income homes. Weatherizing homes can increase their value, and can also lower energy bills, thereby increasing assets (cash) for homeowners. Income-eligible homeowners who have difficulty paying their energy bills can apply for Energy Assistance. GCCAC also employs a full-time Energy Specialist who can counsel homeowners who have questions about energy conservation and alternative and renewable energy systems.

From time to time, homeowners may find themselves in the difficult position of impending foreclosure of their homes. A Foreclosure Prevention counselor is ready to assist homeowners who are facing foreclosure. Preventing foreclosure is a way of preserving homeownership which is another way of assisting clients in maintaining the equity (wealth) they have in their homes.
<h4>Home Repair and Rehab Program</h4>
<img src=""https://www.garrettcac.org/images/Graphics/Home_Repair.png"" alt=""Home Repair"" width=""100"" height=""97"" />
This program assists homeowners in preserving equity in their homes (which are assets) by making repairs to them which will eliminate health and safety hazards.  For the elderly, these repairs can mean the difference between aging in place or moving to a nursing home.  Many times, homes that are repaired under this program can then be eligible for Weatherization Assistance

mpowering families with limited resources to obtain their home by offering counseling, training, and down payment assistance through partnerships with local banks, USDA Rural Development, and DHCD through the Maryland Mortgage Program. Up to 65 participants assisted each year.

Home 1.5This program assists clients in the development of assets by assisting them in purchasing a home. The asset in this case is a home, which, with proper maintenance and care, should increase in value over time. The first step in the program is to attend a workshop (presented on two consecutive Monday evenings at the Mary Browning Senior Center). For dates of the First Time Home Owner Workshop see ""News and Events"" under Announcements menu. See ""Homebuyer Workshop"" under the Education/Life Long Learning menu for details.

Family Support was created to meet the needs of Maryland families with children, birth to 3, who have been identified as having developmental delays or disabilities. Each local FSN, which is staffed by a parent of a child with a disability, provides information to families regarding community services; refers families to local support groups, workshops, and advocacy groups; provides opportunities for families to network and share ideas and experiences; and helps to link ""experienced"" parents with parents of newly identified children with similar special needs.

<strong><span class=""ms-rteForeColor-1"">Family Support</span> (3 through 5)</strong>

To help support families during the transition from the Infants and Toddlers Program (ITP) to the local school schystem (LSS) preschool special education program or other community-based early childhood setting—or from preschol into a school-age program—the Maryland State Department of Education makes funding available to expand services provided thorugh local family support. Family Support provides ongoing support to families of children ages 3 through 5, maintaining the connection with the local ITP, as well as fostering new connections among families, preschool programs, and community services.

<strong class=""ms-rteForeColor-1"">Family Support </strong><strong>(5 to 21)</strong>

Family Support Centers, established as part of each local school system in Maryland, have as their goal the provision of knowledge and the development of essential skills fundamental to parents and professionals working together as equal partners in the educational decision making process. Specifically, Family Support Centers seek to:
<ul>
 	<li>Increase parental involvement in the special education decision making process</li>
 	<li>Provide information and resources about disabilities and community services</li>
 	<li>Assist families in resolving concerns and making informed decisions regarding their child's education</li>
 	<li>Increase collaborative relationships through information and training</li>

Adult guardianship is a legal procedure in which a court of law determines that a person (age 65 or over) has disabilities which impair the person’s ability to make informed decisions, that the person is in need of protection, and that there is no less restrictive alternative. Guardianship is a way for the state, in form of the court, to enter into the life of an older adult to ensure that the person’s basic needs are met.

The Allegany County Area Agency on Aging (AAA) acts as guardian of last resort for such individuals, after all other higher priority alternatives have been exhausted. The guardian/designee takes an active part in the person’s life, providing case management services and advocating to meet his/her needs. Those services include but are not limited to health care intervention, arranging for legal representation and care coordination.

Prior to filing a guardianship petition, two physicians must certify that the person is incapable of making decisions. Both physicians must have examined the person and made a medical judgment regard the person’s mental capacity prior to completing the certificates. These certifications may become evidence in the case, or the doctors may be witnesses who testify in the case.

The Children's League- A Children's Place,"<span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>The Children's League,</strong>  incorporated as The League for Crippled Children, Inc., a non-profit 501 © (3) organization, has been in existence since 1926 and incorporated in 1934.  Initially, Dr. George Bennett of Baltimore, organized a clinic in Lonaconing just fifteen minutes from Cumberland, at the request of Mrs. Ann Sloan in 1926. Nearly 90 children attended the first clinic and many of those children were afflicted with polio. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Bennett and Dr. William S. Baer held the first clinic in Cumberland. Two clinics a year were scheduled.</span>

<span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Seven years later, the League was formally formed and incorporated, thanks to the founders, Miss Henrietta Schwartzenbach and Miss Elizabeth McLaughlin. The first two clinics sponsored by the League were conducted by Dr. Bennett with Dr. George Eaton assisting. 308 children were examined.</span>

<span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Since that time, over 40,000 children have been served. The League serves children birth to age 21 in Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia. All services at the League are FREE to ALL patients and families. Those services include orthopedic, cerebral palsy, cleft lip/cleft palate, speech therapy and physical therapy.</span>

Several orthopedic and cerebral palsy clinics are held throughout the year by pediatric orthopedic surgeons from Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Baltimore area. With no pediatric orthopedists in the Cumberland area families are well served through these League clinics. Physical therapy is offered to patients seen in clinic and that are recommended by physician to receive physical therapy.

The League manages and operates the Cumberland Cleft Clinic offering free services to cleft lip/palate children. A team of ten local physicians and specialists hold orofacial clinics twice each year. Headed by local plastic surgeon Dr. Rob Carpenter, Cumberland Cleft Clinic is committed to serving and meeting the needs of children with cleft lip and/or cleft palate.

The League also operates and manages the Scottish Rite Early Childhood Language Disorders Clinic. The clinic provides diagnostic evaluation and treatment of speech and language disorders in children. Children who may be behind for a lifetime are now given services that help them to speak, read, and equip them with the ability to lead productive lives.

The League operates strictly through donations, fundraising, memorials and bequests. The League receives no state or federal funds. A fifteen member volunteer Board of Directors governs the organization.",children;disabled-populations,childrensleague@yahoo.com,301.759.2677,,301.759.5200,,https://www.facebook.com/TheChildrensLeague/,,4456

I focus on adolescents, adults, and elders. I offer traditional psychotherapeutic services such as individual and family therapy. In addition, I also focus on psychotherapy in conjunction with focused breath and movement work for clients experiencing stress related to verbal, physical or sexual abuse, harsh environments, accidents, injuries or other traumas, as well as those struggling with negative body image.

A somewhat different approach to psychotherapy, in addition to the traditional conversational approach, has been prompted by my interest in recent neuropsychological research on the effects of focused breathing and movement on brain function.

Researchers who specialize in trauma victims, such as  Bessel van der Kolk, MD, have found that movement in treating various types of trauma can be as effective as talk therapy and medication.

Trauma and stress affect the entire body, for example the immune system, gastrointestinal system, and the sense of being in one’s own skin. Moving and working with the breath promotes staying in the present and helps to reduce the effects of stress on the body.

Often individuals who feel isolated benefit greatly from movement with others (such as yoga and T’ai Chi Chih) assisting with body awareness and social interaction.

As a trained neuropsychologist, I also offer batteries of neuropsychological testing. These assessments can help determine the loss of mental abilities. The testing can assess how well the person is able to understand new information or how well s/he can explain himself. Assessments also help to determine how well the person is able to organize his/her thoughts and how closely a person is able to pay attention. This type of information might be useful in determining the nature of a mental disability and if a person is able to make important decisions on his/her own.

I am a licensed clinical psychologist with a post-doctoral certification in neuropsychology. I have 25 years experience in individual, group and family therapies as well as personality, cognitive and neuropsychological assessment in both outpatient and inpatient settings. I am a Fellow of the Maryland Psychological Association. I recently retired as Director of Psychological Services at Thomas B. Finan Center. In addition, I am a certified T’ai Chi Chih and  Seijaku instructor, as well as a certified yoga teacher, having completed a 200-hour yoga teacher certification at White Lotus Foundation, Santa Barbara, CA.

I currently serve private pay clients and I am an in-network provider for Medicare and CareFirst, a  Blue Cross/Blue Shield company. Out of network benefits may be available based on your individual insurance plan

Committed to Change,"&nbsp;
<h2 data-fontsize=""35"" data-lineheight=""45"">Adult and Minor Outpatient Mental Health Program</h2>
<strong>Program Philosophy:</strong>

It is the philosophy of the Committed To Change, PC (CTC) Adult Outpatient Mental Health Clinic (OMHC) programs to assist persons with developing and maintaining coping skills that facilitate adjustment and integration within their living environments and community. Clients and family members are empowered to make decisions about their care with the expected outcome of an increased quality of life.

<strong>Program Description:</strong>

CTC, OMHC programs are provided in a clinic setting. A wide range of services are organized within a comprehensive therapeutic environment that includes screening and assessment, diagnostic determination, individual and family counseling, psychiatric consultations, medication management, crisis intervention, group counseling, client advocacy, and referral to community resources. Clients are assigned to licensed clinicians who assist in individual planning and care. Services additionally include consultation with family and/or professional care providers.

<strong>Program Goals:</strong>

The overall goal of CTC, OMHC programs is to increase the quality of life through the provision of specialized outpatient mental health services.  Specific areas of focus may include:
<ul>
 	<li>Recovery</li>
 	<li>Vocation/Education</li>
 	<li>Parenting</li>
 	<li>Relationships</li>
 	<li>Spirituality</li>
 	<li>Coping Skills</li>
 	<li>Anger Management</li>
 	<li>Grief and Loss</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Program Objectives:</strong>

CTC, OMHC programs seek to achieve the following specific objectives:
<ul>
 	<li>To improve mood and affect in daily living.</li>
 	<li>To improve social, familial, and social adjustment and integration.</li>
 	<li>To reduce the need for a higher level of care.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Program Services/Continuum of Care:</strong>

CTC, OMHC programs provide a continuum of care that ensures all clients and family members referred are evaluated and provided services and/or referred to primary and secondary service providers to meet their individual needs. The specific areas that demonstrate a continuum of care are as follows:

<strong>Screening and Intake Assessment:</strong> A screening and intake process is completed 14 days of the initial referral. The strengths, needs, abilities, and preferences of each client are identified explicitly for integration within an individual plan of care.

<strong>Individual Treatment Planning:</strong> An Individual Treatment Plan is developed with each consumer within the first 5 billable services performed by CTC staff.  The client is a full participant in the treatment planning and goals. And, objectives are based on individual needs, strengths, abilities and preferences. Goals are stated in the client’s own language, and the client has open access to the individual plan upon request.

<strong>Individual, Group, and Family Therapy:</strong> Each client is assigned a licensed therapist who is responsible for the client’s coordination of care. Individualized, group, and/or family therapy sessions take place to assist the client in both individual treatment plan goals and objectives.

<strong>Crisis Intervention:</strong> Emergency response to mental health crisis is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. CTC’s automated phone messaging system provides patients with an afterhours number which goes to one of the OMHC Program Director (Annapolis site) as well as directions for going to the local hospital in certain situations.

<strong>Medication Management:</strong>  Medication management is available to assist with an increase in life functioning. Through the services of qualified physicians, medications are prescribed and their efficacy is evaluated on an ongoing basis. Education is provided to individual clients regarding the effects, use, and expected outcomes of medication.

<strong>Psychosocial Education:</strong> Psychosocial education is available to clients, families, care providers in both individual and group formats and provided to assist with interpersonal relations, role performance, anger management, and communication skills.

<strong>Progress Reviews and Individual Plan Reformulation:</strong> Regular scheduled meetings are held with each client to review the progress of their individual goals and update and/or revise the Individual Plan.

<strong>Discharge/Transition Planning and Criteria:</strong> Discharge/transition planning occurs throughout all phases of the program. The person served has met discharge/transition criteria when the goals of the individual plan are achieved and referral to support services is completed, when appropriate.

&nbsp;

<strong>Mechanisms to Address the Needs of Special Populations: </strong>CTC, OMHC programs addresses the special needs of the clients served through the development and ongoing monitoring and modification of the Individual Treatment Plan. Through this process, the strengths, abilities, needs, preferences and desired outcomes will be developed based on the unique qualities of the clients served. Specific accommodations to address special needs may include the following; amplification devices and writing boards for use with hearing impaired clients, magnification sheets for the visually impaired, and language interpretation of non-English speaking clients.",mental-health-services,,1-240-362-7409,,240-580-1919,,,,2095

Dental Wellness Center,"<header>
<h1 class=""title"">Dental Wellness Center: Integrative care for the whole body</h1>
</header>
<div class=""content clearfix"">

The Dental Wellness Center is Western Maryland’s first and only integrative dental practice. Described variously as holistic, alternative or biological care, integrative dentistry combines the best methods of conventional dentistry with scientifically sound, minimally invasive treatment options that promote whole-body health.

Do you have chronic neck and shoulder pain, earaches or headaches, trouble sleeping or breathing? These and other symptoms often relate directly to the health of your mouth, one of your body’s most direct interfaces with the environment (and, it follows, the health care system). It is a natural gateway for addressing many and various health issues that may arise from diet, medications, lifestyle and a host of other factors typically ignored by conventional dentistry.

Integrative care is considered a relatively new medical approach, even though it borrows from proven, age-old traditions when appropriate. From preventive therapy to cancer treatment, integrative care is transforming medicine for the better. Like many new things, it has its critics (often with vested interests in the status quo). And while we would agree that some integrative practitioners overreach, the same surely holds true in conventional medicine.

The Dental Wellness Center approach is based on credible, at times emergent science. We advocate for our patients, not dentistry. If that rubs the establishment the wrong way, so be it. The fact is, many new patients seek us out after disappointment with conventional treatments. Others are simply resigned to or unaware of chronic or potential problems routinely unaddressed conventionally.

Dr. Marc DiNola and the Dental Wellness Center staff welcome patients of all ages. We accept most insurance plans and can offer financing in most cases. Be assured that we never pressure patients into treatment plans or product purchases.

Covenant Counseling,"<h1 class=""page-title"">Individual Counseling</h1>
Individual counseling is provided for any client experiencing a difficult issue - from communication conflicts to more complex mental health disorders or addictions. Covenant Counseling has seven licensed professionals to meet the individual needs of our community. The initial intake is obtained by calling our office at 301-777-0633 and speaking to our receptionists.

A therapist is assigned to each individual needing counseling with the first appointment usually scheduled for 90 minutes. Thereafter, each session is approximately 55 minutes.

Depending on the issue presented by the client, various testing may be recommended as well as homework assignments from the resource center. These assignments are to better equip clients to reach their goals successfully.

Above all, confidentiality from the very first phone call is maintained. Covenant Counseling strives to help individuals work through their issues in a safe environment.
<h1 class=""page-title"">Family Counseling</h1>
Family counseling is offered for couples and/or families experiencing conflicts or problems disruptive to the entire family unit. Mental health disorders, chronic illness, death, and divorce are just some of the topics presented during family sessions. Adolescents and children often serve as the identified client in family therapy.
<h1 class=""page-title"">Group Counseling</h1>
Group counseling is offered periodically concerning various topics whereby many individuals identify dilemmas. Codependency, adult children of alcoholics (ACOA), boundaries, anti-bullying, and freedom from addictions are examples of such group topics. These group sessions are always professional in nature with one or two of our therapists serving as facilitators.

The purpose of group counseling is to focus on common difficulties, to provide support and encouragement, and to discuss workable ideas for embracing and working through the issue.

Covenant Counseling will make known to the public via the website, newspaper, and other media the dates, times, and number of available persons attending of any group offerings. Group norms and rules will be provided during the initial session to all attendees. Confidentiality is expected from all participants at group counseling events.",counseling;mental-health-services,,,,301.777.0633,http://covenantcounselingministries.org/,,,3726

Willow Creek Adult Care Center,"HRDC operates two Adult Medical Day Services programs in Allegany County – one in Cumberland and the other in Lonaconing. Anyone 16 years of age or older who has difficulty with two or more activities of daily living (ADLs) such as cooking, bathing, dressing and taking medications is eligible to enroll with the support of his/her physician. The over-arching mission of adult care services is to assist people in maintaining or improving their quality of life, to help them remain in the community and to avert premature institutionalization.

Adult Care provides a small breakfast, a big lunch and a light afternoon snack. All meals are approved by a registered dietician. Special menus are available with doctor’s orders. Adult Care also provides safe and dependable transportation to and from the center and to most medical appointments. We offer marketing, bowling, day trips, festivals, train rides, lunches at area restaurants, arts and crafts, bingo, card games, Bible study, talent shows and special entertainment such as singers, dancers and motivational speakers. Hours of operation are Monday – Friday, 8:00 am – 4:00 pm at each center.

Methods of payment for services range from medical assistance to a sliding fee scale for private pay. If a client has medical assistance and is state-approved to attend Adult Care there is no cost for the program. The Maryland Office of Health Services has grant funding available to help with the cost of the program if needed. The Developmental Disabilities Administration also assists with the program if eligible and the Veterans Administration pays for the cost of the program five days per week for all qualified Veterans.",disabled-populations;aging-populations,tvanvlack@alleganyhrdc.org,,,301-777-8422,http://alleganyhrdc.org/adult-medical-day-services/,,,3017

<h4>About The Cascades</h4>
The Cascades is a 71 unit affordable housing community in <a href=""https://affordablehousingonline.com/housing-search/Maryland/Cumberland"">Cumberland</a>, <a href=""https://affordablehousingonline.com/housing-search/Maryland"">Maryland</a>. The community is located in the 6th Congressional District of Maryland.

</div>
<div class=""clearfix""> Low Income Housing Tax Credit</div>
Since this property has received funding in part through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, monthly rent cannot exceed the Tax Credit maximum rent for the area. Households earning less than 60% of the area median income qualify for units with reduced rent. Some rental units in this property may not be subject to LIHTC and therefore may be set at levels higher than the area's LIHTC limits.
<h4>HOME</h4>
The HOME Rental Assistance Program provides affordable housing to low and moderate income families. Apartment communities that participate in the program must ensure that 90% of units are occupied by households at or below 60% of the area median income and the remaining 10% of the units are occupied by households at or below 80% of the area median income. Furthermore, if the community has five or more units participating in the HOME program, 20% of those units must be occupied for households at or below 50% of the area median income.

The Cascades was built in part with financing obtained through the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. In addition to providing apartments for low-income households, this property could include some market rate units. Households earning 60% or less of the Area Median Income (AMI) qualify for targeted rental units in LIHTC financed housing. This property may also designate units for renters with even lower incomes, from 60% of AMI down to 30% AMI. It is even possible that all units have been set aside for those with extremely low incomes (as low as 15% of AMI). This means that the same size unit can rent for different amounts based on the income of the renter.

Figuring out income and rent limits for affordable housing can be complex when more than one Federal program is involved. To know for sure if you qualify, you must contact the property directly. The amounts provided here should only be used as a basic guide.",aging-populations,,,,301.724.3033,,https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cascade-Senior-Apartments/810230262436161,,2969

Countryhouse Residence for memory care,"CountryHouse is a <a href=""http://countryhouse.net/memory-care-assisted-living"">memory care residence</a>. The word <em>residence </em>is used purposefully, because we want everyone to feel at home here. Anything that might look or feel like a hospital or nursing home is avoided, such as institutional signage, lunch trays, scrubs and rigid schedules. Residents are invited to bring their own furniture and mementos, and we learn each one’s story to engage them and truly integrate them into the CountryHouse family.

In addition, our services extend to families. From supporting those who are still caring for a loved one at home, to education and special family events, CountryHouse cares for all those whose lives have been touched by Alzheimer’s. We understand that in different ways, the toll it takes on families is just as great as on the person with the disease.

Because we believe in <em>treating people like family</em> at CountryHouse, you can rest assured that your loved one will be cared for with the utmost compassion, integrity and commitment.",aging-populations;alzheimers;senior-citizen-services,nstratton@countryhouse.net,,,301.777.8717,http://countryhouse.net/,https://www.facebook.com/CountryHouseCumberland/,,2546

Community First Choice/Community Options Waiver,"Community First Choice is a program that provides assistance and support to enable older adults and people with disabilities to safely live in their own homes or delay nursing facility placement until absolutely necessary. To enroll in the program individuals must have medical assistance and also a debilitating medical condition which requires assistance with activities of daily living (assistance with cooking, bathing, dressing, light household chores, medication administration, transportation and decision making).

This program is self-directed meaning the client is the decision maker.  The client receives funding to purchase necessary items for their personal safety and wellbeing.  The client may elect to purchase grab bars for their bathroom, home delivered meals, emergency response systems, or pay for a person to assist them in daily grooming and household chores.  Individuals make their own decisions and receives support from a program advocate.

To apply for the program call the Maryland Access Point (MAP) office at Community Action by dialing 301-334-9431.  The MAP Coordinator will discuss the program with you and/or a family member to determine preliminary eligibility.  If you meet the financial eligibility criteria a nurse from the health department will make an appointment with you to determine if you may meet the other requirements.  Enrollment into the program may take as long as 4 to 6 weeks.

In many ways, a child’s behavior represents his attitudes which are shaped by his values, his view of himself, and the environment around him.

We believe learning occurs when realistic expectations are made in a climate in which the learner is valued.</div>
<div>The nursery school experience is a benefit to the child when it stimulates him/her intellectually; broadens his/her social abilities to accept security with adults; and companionship with his/her peers; influences growth toward self-discipline; and promotes health, physical growth, motor development and self-expression.</div>

Our goals for your child are the same as those published by Association for Childhood Education International and the National Association for Education of Young Children. They are:</div>
<div>to promote health, physical growth and motor development
to increase independence in meeting and solving problems
to strengthen inner emotional controls
to recognize reasonable limits and to influence growth toward self-discipline
to encourage self-liking and self-confidence and self-understanding
to foster security with adults
to stimulate liking for children of different ages and backgrounds
to promote the language skills
to promote self-expression in art, music and dance
to broaden intellectual horizons
to help children to observe, investigate, seek and acquire information, and think critically.</div>

The Veterans Crisis Line,"<strong>PRESS 1</strong>

If you’re a Veteran in crisis or know a Veteran who is, confidential support is only a phone call, click, or text away — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

The Veterans Crisis Line, <a href=""https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/ChatTermsOfService.aspx"">online chat</a>, and text-messaging service are free to all Veterans, even if you are not registered with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or enrolled in VA health care. Hundreds of Veterans call us every day, and start to get back on track.

The Veterans Crisis Line is staffed by caring, qualified VA responders — some of whom are Veterans themselves. They understand what Veterans have been through and the challenges Veterans of all ages and service eras face.

Crisis feels different for everybody and can arise from a wide range of situations before, during, or after military service. Some Veterans are coping with aging, stress, or similar challenges faced during civilian life while others may experience difficulties in their relationships or transitioning back to employment or education.

Whatever’s got you down — chronic pain, anxiety, depression, sleeplessness, anger, or even homelessness — a Veterans Crisis Line responder can provide support, day or night.",veterans,,,,1.800.273.8255,https://www.veteranscrisisline.net/ForVeterans.aspx,,,1328

Developmental Disabilities Administration,"People with developmental disabilities have the right to direct their lives and services. The DDA partners with people with developmental disabilities to provide support and resources to live fulfilling lives.

The DDA provides a coordinated service delivery system, so that people receive appropriate services oriented toward the goal of full integration into their community. The DDA’s community-based service delivery system includes various home and community-based services and supports provided through either a Medicaid State Plan, Waiver program or via DDA State funded services.

People receiving services through DDA also receive help from family members, community organizations, and other programs outside of the DDA. The DDA also administers two State Residential Centers (SRCs) and two Forensic Residential Centers (FRCs).

There is a high demand for funding for services from the DDA. The DDA currently is unable to meet all the requests, so it established a waiting list. The waiting list is prioritized so that people with the greatest need are helped first. The DDA follows regulations to determine eligibility, priority category and placement on the waiting list. People who apply to the DDA, but do not need services within the next three years,​ are placed on the Future Needs Registry.",children;emergency-services;youth-services,,,,(844) 253-8694,https://dda.health.maryland.gov/Pages/providers.aspx,https://www.facebook.com/MarylandDDA/,,2634

<h6 class=""font_6"">There is no stigma in seeking help!</h6>
<p class=""font_8"">People pursue counseling and therapy for a variety of reasons. Some may enter therapy to address major life changes, such as divorce, and others may seek help in managing mental health conditions, like depression. There's a common misconception that people who go to therapy are ""crazy,"" when in fact, most therapy clients are ordinary people struggling with common, everyday issues.</p>
<p class=""font_8""><span class=""wixGuard"">​</span></p>
<p class=""font_8"">Many people seek counseling because they have identified specific goals or issues that they wish to work on. Others may be encouraged by family, friends, or medical professionals to seek help, and in some cases, a person may be mandated to attend therapy as part of a court ruling or by a parent or guardian (if the person is a minor). Whatever the impetus, it takes courage to attend therapy, and it takes dedication to see it through. Together, the client and the therapist will determine the goals of therapy, and if the therapy should be short- or long-term. In many cases, the therapist and client will explore much more than just the client's presenting problem—the issue that first brought the person to therapy. The help of the right therapist can promote self-actualization, empower self-growth, improve relationships, and reduce emotional suffering.*</p>
